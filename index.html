                    <p class="lede">World IA Day is an accessible one-day conference aimed at bringing the Information Architecture community together.</p>
                    <p>Come February 20th, 2016, we’ll be celebrating our fifth annual World IA Day in many cities across the globe.

It's also a fantastic opportunity to have talks and content tailored specifically to your local community and in your local language.</p>

                    <h2>The basics of running your local World IA Day</h2>
                    <p>We believe local leadership and autonomy in decision-making is key to successful, culturally relevant events.</p>
                    <p>We recommend you start thinking about the operations of your local event shortly after you apply. Each year, organizers run it a bit differently, but generally we see successful event timelines run something like this…</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Build a local team:</strong> You start building a team by connecting with a few folks in your community who are interested in filling out the call for cities proposal with you. The Information Architecture Institute reviews all submissions and notifies the cities of whether or not they are accepted. Once accepted, you can grow your team and plan your event with the support of the Information Architecture Institute global leaders.</li>
                        <li><strong>You check in with global.</strong> The Information Architecture Institute global team will check in with you regularly to make sure you’re getting the support you need. We will let you know what other local leaders are doing across the globe and help you problem-solve any issues that arise. We’ll provide guidelines on when and how things could be done to help you if you’re new to event planning.</li>
                        <li><strong>You manage your own event logistics.</strong> While we don’t mandate event management in a certain way, we know a general planning schedule might look something like this:
                            <dl>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>You host your event!</strong> On February 20th, 2016, you’ll host your very own World IA Day - the format and content is up to you. The day can be filled with talks, roundtable chats, workshops, or something we haven’t even thought of yet. The only thing that we ask is that you keep your event accessible to all in your community and ours. The Information Architecture Institute global team will help promote your tweets, live streams, and video uploads as your event takes place.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>At each step, we will provide advice, templates, toolkits, and any other planning tools you request to make sure that you're well equipped to run your event.</p>

                        <p>The [organizing] experience couldn't have been better. I was very concerned that I wouldn't be doing something correctly, but the amount of support from the IA Institute was unbelievable. Any questions or concerns I had were immediately answered, and any help I needed was given quickly. The day went unbelievably well, and we are happy to be answering the Call for Cities again in 2016 in the hopes of hosting World IA Day again!&rdquo;</p>
